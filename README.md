# Animal-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neuron-Networks

## In deep learning, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that's commonly implemented in visual imagery analyzing. This algorithm is actually quite simple to understand, and we can classify this 6 x 6 image of the integer 2 below as an example:

## The first step is to design a filter, which can be a 3 x 3 image, and match it with every combination of connected 3 x 3 portions from the original image, and there are 16 of them.
