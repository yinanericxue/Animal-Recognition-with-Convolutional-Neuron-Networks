# Animal-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neuron-Networks

## In deep learning, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that's commonly implemented in visual imagery analyzing. This algorithm is actually quite simple to understand, and we can classify this 6 x 6 image of the integer 2 below as an example.
